Requirements Definition and Query Language (RQDQL)

  IEEE 830-1998 says: "<SRS (software requirements specification) should be
  correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, ranked for importance and/or stability,
  verifiable, modifiable, traceable>". RQDQL is going to enable the creation
  of such documents in plain text format. If you're interested to join the group
  developing RQDQL, email to {{{mailto:team@rqdql.com}team@rqdql.com}}.

  Software Design Document (SDD) is available {{{./pdf/sdd.pdf}in PDF}}.

  This software was initially developed in C++. Now we're transferring it
  to Java and this work is not finished yet. A complete (compilable and working)
  version in C++ is available in Subversion:
  <<<svn://svn.rqdql.com/rqdql/tags/rqdql-0.4-latest/cpp>>>.
