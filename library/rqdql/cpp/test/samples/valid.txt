ActorUser is a "human".
PhotoFile is a "file".
UC14.78 where ActorUser (the user) uploads PhotoFile (the new-file):
1. "The user uploads the new-file".
2. The user reads the new-file.
3. We seriously validate name of the new-file when we want it.
UC25.4 where we seriously validate PhotoFile (the file) when we want it: "we will define it later".
