Requs Syntax

  {{{http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/830-1998_desc.html}IEEE 830-1998}}
  says: "SRS (<software requirements specification>) should be
  correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, ranked for importance and/or stability,
  verifiable, modifiable, traceable". Requs is a Controlled Natural Language
  that enables the creation of such documents in plain text format.

* Quick Start

  The scope definition document consists of <<types>>
  and <<methods>> (aka "use cases"). For example, there are two types
  (<<<Visitor>>> and <<<Image>>>) and one
  use case (<<<UC3.2>>>) defined in the snippet:

+--
Visitor is "an originator of HTTP request".
UC3.2 where User (a user) deletes photos:
  "we will define it later...".
Image includes: PNG content, name, and size.
+--

  Anything inside double quotes is considered as
  informal content, which we take "as is", without
  any attempt to understand what it means. You can double quote anything
  (except double quotes, of course), and you can place
  informal texts in any place of the document. They are ignored
  during formal Requs analysis.

  Let's consider a bigger example of a type <<<Image>>>:

+--
Image includes:
  PNG content as File "a binary content as defined by ISO-15948",
  name as "a unique alpha-numeric name of the image",
  size as "the total number of bytes in PNG content".
+--

  The semantic is the same -- the type still contains three <<slots>>
  (<<<PNG content>>>, <<<name>>> and <<<size>>>). However
  in this example we added an informal explanation to every one of them.
  An <<<as>>> keyword separates the name of the slot and its invariant.

  Pay attention to the dots, colons, semicolons and commas used above.
  Comma, semicolon and preposition <<<and>>> can replace each other.
  For example, the following declarations are semantically equivalent:

+--
PNG content as File and name and size
PNG content as File, name, size
PNG content as File; name; and size
+--

  By means of <<<is>>>/<<<is a>>> we enable a declaration of <<invariants>>
  on types. Invariant is a <<predicate>>, which is always true, no matter
  what happens with the system. In the example above it is always true
  that <<<PNG content>>> is a file with binary content (not a readable
  ASCII text). Nobody can break this invariant and put a textual information
  into this slot.

  As you noticed, an invariant can be declared with an informal text, as we've
  done with <<<size>>>. Such a declaration means
  absolutely nothing and will be ignored. But it helps when you're starting
  to develop the SRS document.

  In general, <<informal texts>> play an important role during the initial
  development of a requirements document and
  during a preliminary system analysis. When you don't know for sure
  how to define the information you have in a strict format -- you
  should use informal texts. Later, when you have more information,
  you will replace them.

  Requs is a case-insensitive language in all places
  except one -- type names should use
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase}CamelCase Notation}}. Thus,
  <<<Fie>>>, <<<ImageFile>>>, and <<<VeryBigImageFile>>> are valid type
  names, while <<<imagefile>>> is just an English word.

* Bigger Example

  To put things together we should declare a use case, which is
  a step-by-step explanation of interaction between instances of types
  (so called <<objects>>), for example:

+--
UC8.1 where User (a user) shares Image with User (a friend):
  1. The user creates Image (a photo).
  2. The user updates the friend "selecting one of his contacts".
  3. The photo converts "to the right PNG format, 600x600 maximum".
  4. The friend receives email using SmtpServer.
  5. The friend reads the photo "in his own web page".
UC8.1/1 when "the user exceeds the maximum possible number of photos":
  1. Fail since "photos limit exceeded".
UC8.1/3 when "invalid format":
  1. "We notify user about the problem".
  2. Fail since "can't convert photo".
+--

  First line in this example is a declaration of a use case,
  which number is <<<UC8.1>>>. The use case has a <<signature>>,
  which differentiates it from all other use cases. It is not the
  ID of the use case, but the signature, which is important. This
  concept is very similar to
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_(computer_science)}function signature}}
  in programming. The signature of this use case is:

+--
User shares Image with User
+--

  In order to include this use case into another one we should use this
  signature, filling it with particular objects. Objects start with
  article <<<the>>>. On their first occurrence they appear in round brackets
  and start with <<<a>>> or <<<an>>>.

  In our use case there are three objects: <<<the user>>>,
  <<<the friend>>> and <<<the photo>>>. An object could be
  either received by a use case or created inside it. However, there is no grammar
  difference between objects received and objects created. We assume
  that an object is empty until anyone updates or creates it (more on this later).

  There are seven <<main flows>> in this use case, and five <<alternative
  flows>>. Flows <<<1>>>, <<<5>>>, <<<6>>>, and <<<7>>>
  instruct us to include other use cases that match the signatures
  provided and pass them the objects we have.

* USING

  In the example above, one of the use case steps
  mentioned <<using>> operator:

+--
The friend receives email using SmtpServer.
+--

  This is similar to sending arguments to a method. In this line
  we're calling a method "receives" on "the friend" object like this:

+--
friend.receives_email(smtp_server);
+--

* CRUDL

  There are four use cases that are included by <<<UC8.1>>>.
  They have to be defined somewhere else in the document,
  otherwise the document will be semantically incomplete. But not all four are
  mandatory, because there is a number of <<elementary use cases>>,
  which are defined in the system, even if the document is
  empty. The elementary use cases are
  ({{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete}CRUD}} requirements pattern):

+--
Something creates something
Something reads something
Something updates something
Something deletes something
Something lists something
+--

  As you understand, <<<something>>> means "object of any type".
  <<<create>>> means making/instantiating of a new object.
  <<<read>>> means reading of all and any slots of an object, and all their slots, etc.
  <<<update>>> means changing of values of slots of an object.
  <<<delete>>> means removing an object from a persistent storage.

  Thus, a valid flow either points us to another use case
  defined somewhere else in the document, or points us to
  an elementary use case, or points us nowhere with an informal text
  (<<informal flow>>).

* Exceptions

  Besides that, a flow might have a special instruction, which we've seen
  in alternative flow <<<UC8.3/1>>> and <<<UC8.3/3>>>. <<<fail since>>>
  means that a use case should be stopped at this point and the
  reason of this termination is explained right after the word <<<since>>>
  as an informal text.

  Reason of failure is used by a parent use case, which included the
  current one. This is exactly what happens in <<<UC8.3/3>>>. We are
  waiting for a failure from <<<we convert the photo>>>, and
  we're ready to accept a failure called <<<invalid format>>>.
  This approach is very similar to
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling}exception handling paradigm}}
  in object-oriented languages.

* Scope Ambiguity

  There is only one metric that tells us everything about
  the entire scope definition document. The metric is called
  "<<scope ambiguity>>" and is calculated like:

+--
A = S / (S + M)
+--

  <S> stands for a total number of all informal flows,
  and <M> is a total number of CRUD-manipulators.
  Thus, if <A> equals to 0, the document is absolutely non-ambiguous,
  which is an almost impossible situation. In real world projects
  the task of a system analyst is to move <A> from 1 to 0.

* Arity of Slots

  A slot may have an "arity", determined by a suffix attached to its name. There
  are four possible options:

+--
User includes: name, address-s, photo-s?, and SSN-?.
+--

  <<<-s>>> means "one or many" or <<<1..*>>> in UML.

  <<<-?>>> means "zero or one" or <<<0..1>>> in UML.

  <<<-s?>>> means "zero or many" or <<<0..*>>> in UML.

  No suffix means exactly one, or <<<1..1>>> in UML.

* Attributes

  Any use case may have attributes assigned to it. Attributes
  may be used, for example, for
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement_prioritization}requirements prioritization}}.

+--
:UC3.2 is a must.
:UC8 is delivered.
:UC2 is specified.
+--

  You can "seal" your statement with a hash code:

+--
af63e2:UC3.2 is a must.
+--

  This hash code <<<af63e2>>> is calculated from the content of <<<UC3.2>>>.
  If the content is changed, this statement becomes invalid and the entire
  document can't be compiled any more.

* Non-Functional Requirements

  To any use case you can add a number of non-functional requirements (NFR),
  in the following format:

+--
UC3.2/MTBF must "be 5 minutes on a standard equipment".
UC7/PERF must "be less than 500 msec per request".
+--

  After the name of the use case you put a forward slash and then
  a mnemonic name of a non-functional requirement. Then, you put
  "must be" and an informal text.

* Markdown Pages

  Sometimes you may need to add informal pages to your SRS document. For
  example, Vision, Business Case, wireframes, UI mockups, tables,
  research results, supplementary tables, etc. The syntax is simple:

+--
Vision: """
Any text you wish, in Markdown format.
""".
